# Product Context: Mostlymatter Docker

## What is Mostlymatter?
Mostlymatter is a theme for [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/) developed by Framasoft, a French non-profit organization focused on free and open-source software. The original project is hosted at [Framagit](https://framagit.org/framasoft/framateam/mostlymatter).

## Why This Project Exists
This Docker containerization project exists to:

1. **Simplify Deployment**: Make mostlymatter easier to deploy by packaging it in a standardized container format
2. **Ensure Consistency**: Provide a consistent environment for running mostlymatter across different systems
3. **Enable Integration**: Allow for easier integration with container orchestration systems like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc.
4. **Automate Updates**: Create an automated pipeline that keeps Docker images in sync with upstream releases

## Problems It Solves

1. **Installation Complexity**: Eliminates the need for manual installation and dependency management
2. **Environment Consistency**: Prevents "works on my machine" problems by standardizing the runtime environment
3. **Version Management**: Simplifies upgrading and downgrading between different versions
4. **Distribution**: Makes it easier to distribute mostlymatter to users who prefer containerized applications

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**: Users should be able to deploy mostlymatter with minimal configuration
2. **Reliability**: Containers should be stable and perform consistently
3. **Transparency**: Users should have clear visibility into what version they're running
4. **Flexibility**: Support various deployment scenarios and configurations

## Target Users

1. **System Administrators**: Who need to deploy and maintain mostlymatter instances
2. **DevOps Engineers**: Who integrate mostlymatter into larger systems
3. **Framasoft Community**: Who use and contribute to Framasoft projects
4. **Organizations**: Who want to self-host mostlymatter in their infrastructure
